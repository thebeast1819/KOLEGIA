# About Kolegia

Kolegia is an online and mobile application that may be accessed via a web app or an Android app. Kolegia is a platform for college communities to promote their stuff or
belongings inside their campus fraternity. It enables users to trade their belongings or file theft or missing complaint about their goods on the platform. Every instance will be enlarged to all users, and the rest of the users will be alerted about the specific situation. Anyone with knowledge or information about that user can raise their hand and respond to the case, and the user will be informed. Users may be able to tag persons associated with that specific case, which will help to mainstreamthe issue and help to close the case.

# Local Setup


To set up Kolegia for development, you need to follow the steps mentioned below:

### Step 1: Install Node.js from the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/en/).

During the developement process, I used node version `v16.13.0`. You can check your node version by running the following command:

```shell
node -v
```

### Step 2: Setup [React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) environment.

Follow the steps mentioned in the official documentation to setup the environment.

### Step 3: Clone the repository

    git clone https://github.com/AdityaPandey03/Kolegia_FrontEnd.git

### Step 4: Install dependencies

    npm install
### Step 5: Running the application

Run the app in the development mode.
Just type `npm start` in the terminal to open the website.
